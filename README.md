MIARA IS A RECIPE APP
Miara gives you the ability to search for recipes using the Food2Fork api.  Anything that is on Food2Fork will show up on this app.  You can browse through the recipes, save a recipe, or put a recipe on your grocery list.  More on that later!

If you tap the card stack button, you will be given a deck of cards that guide you through the recipe, showing which ingredients need to be added at what points in the recipe.  After you are done with that step, just swipt left or right no move on to the next step!

If you tap the link icon, you will be taken to the blog where the recipe is originally from.  This can be handy if the instruction cards don't make sense, or aren't avialable (reading the recipes from the blogs is a work in progress)

You can also save a list of your favorite recipes to eliminate the need to repeatedly search

You can also create a grocery list that will put every ingredient from every recipe onto a shopping list.  If there are some ingredients that you don't need from the store, you can swipe left and remove them from the list.  You can also add your own items that aren't necessarily on the list, too
